    "# Predicting the NBA Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our tutorial! In this project, the goal is to look at what factors are the most important for NBA draft picks. First, a little bit about the NBA. The National Basketball Association, or NBA, is the highest level professional basketball league in the world. It is composed of 30 teams that play 82 games each, before a playoff bracket is set. The most common way for players to enter the league (After 2006, read more about the rule change [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eligibility_for_the_NBA_draft)) is to be drafted in the NBA draft. The draft consists of 2 rounds, with each team getting 1 pick per round, for a total of 60 picks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this project is to try and predict the [2021 NBA draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_NBA_draft) that will take place on July 29th. Finding out the position of draft picks would be useful for those in the sports industry. A team would be able to predict what players other teams will select, see if players are over/under-rated, or possibly help set sports betting odds. However to start predicting the draft, we must look at past drafts to see what are the most important factors for an NBA draft pick. The project will be broken up into 3 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Wrangling\n",
    "2. Analysis of Previous Drafts\n",
    "3. Predictions of 2021 Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this guide, we hope the reader is able to understand how and why data analysis is done, and would be able to follow similar steps to do some data science on other topics!"

    "Perhaps the most important part is to get the data. This first dataset needed is a collection of past NBA draft picks college stats. This is what we will do analysis on, and train our machine learning model on. We found the website [barttorvik.com](https://www.barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?link=y&year=2022&start=20211101&end=20220501) that contains data on players basketball stats over the years. Secondly, a dataset is needed for the current NBA draft class. With this data, we can feed that into our model and get predictions of the draft order."

To get the data, what I did was manually copy and paste the table into a blank csv file, and then pandas thankfully could interperet it decently enough. I still need to format the df. But if either of you know a better way to import the data, please do it that way/tell me and I can fix it, because copy/pasting is definitely not the best."

From [here](https://www.barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?link=y&year=2022&start=20211101&end=20220501), under the top drop down menu 'all' was selected to get all time. Next, scrolling down the left side, Min%, O-Reb%, D-Reb%, Ast%, Blk%, Stl%, FTR, 2PM, 3PM, and drafted were selected to be shown. Drafted was also set to \"<=\" and \"60\", since there are 60 picks in the NBA draft. After that, \"name\" was clicked twice so the players were sorted by name. Then, the \"Show 100 more\" option was repeatedly selected, until the full 1302 element table was shown. Lastly, the entire table was selected using a cursor, and copy/pasted into a blank csv file that was read into `pandas`.\n",

    "Unfortunately we will not be able to predict everyone in the draft. This is because the deadline for players to announce for the NBA draft is May 30th, and this project is due May 17th. However, most players who will be picked higher up in the rankings declare earlier for the draft, so we can use these early declarations for predictions. [This website](https://ca.nba.com/news/2021-nba-draft-ncaa-players-that-have-declared-for-the-2021-nba-draft-e/hphzsl6bo6dh16t9tpee5628y) contains a nice table of all the players who have declared early thus far. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use this list of names as a cross reference for the 2021 season stats, getting the 2021 season players stats from barttorvik.com again. Like before, this data is created using javascript, so here are the steps for how we manually got the data. First, go to [barttorvik player stats](https://www.barttorvik.com/playerstat.php?year=2021). Make sure the year is 2021. Next, select Min%, O-Reb%, D-Reb%, Ast%, Blk%, Stl%, FTR, 2PM, and 3PM. And once again, show 100 more was selected repeatedly until all 2125 players were visible. Lastly, this was copy/pasted into a csv file, which is read in and processed."
